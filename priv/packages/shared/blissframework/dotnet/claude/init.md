## Claude-Specific Features

- **Structured Thinking** - Problem decomposition and solution planning
- **Code Analysis** - Automated code review and improvement suggestions
- **Architecture Guidance** - Claude-validated design patterns
- **Naming Conventions** - Consistent, Claude-optimized naming
- **Documentation Generation** - Auto-generated, comprehensive docs

## Architecture Patterns

This package includes three key architectural guidance files:

1. **architecture-patterns.txt** - Proven architectural patterns for .NET applications
2. **general-principles.txt** - Core development principles and best practices
3. **naming-conventions.txt** - Consistent naming standards across the codebase

## Getting Started with Claude

1. **Setup Dependencies**
   ```csharp
   // Claude recommends these essential packages
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
   dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore
   dotnet add package AutoMapper
   dotnet add package FluentValidation
   dotnet add package MediatR
   ```

2. **Configure Services (Claude Pattern)**
   ```csharp
   // Structured service registration
   builder.Services.AddDatabase(configuration);
   builder.Services.AddApplicationServices();
   builder.Services.AddInfrastructureServices();
   builder.Services.AddPresentationServices();
   ```

3. **Create Controllers (Claude Style)**
   ```csharp
   [ApiController]
   [Route("api/v1/[controller]")]
   public class UsersController : BaseApiController
   {
       // Claude-optimized controller implementation
       // - Clear method naming
       // - Proper error handling
       // - Comprehensive logging
       // - Structured responses
   }
   ```

## Claude Best Practices

- **Decompose Complex Problems** - Break down features into manageable components
- **Use Clear Naming** - Self-documenting code with descriptive names
- **Implement Proper Logging** - Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Write Comprehensive Tests** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **Document Decisions** - Architectural decision records (ADRs)
- **Follow SOLID Principles** - Maintainable and extensible code structure

## Claude-Enhanced Templates

- **Claude Controller Template** - Controllers with structured thinking patterns
- **Claude Service Template** - Services with clear responsibility separation
- **Claude Model Template** - Models with validation and documentation

## Integration with Claude Code

When using this package with Claude Code:

1. **Automatic Analysis** - Claude analyzes your code structure and suggests improvements
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Identifies and recommends architectural patterns
3. **Code Generation** - Generates boilerplate code following best practices
4. **Documentation** - Creates comprehensive documentation for APIs and services
5. **Refactoring Suggestions** - Recommends code improvements and optimizations

## Working with the Guidance Files

The included guidance files provide:

- **Architecture Patterns** - Detailed explanations of recommended patterns
- **General Principles** - Core development principles to follow
- **Naming Conventions** - Consistent naming across controllers, services, and models

Read these files carefully and apply the patterns consistently throughout your project.
