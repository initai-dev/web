## What is Bliss Framework?

Created by Ondrej Valenta, the Bliss Framework represents years of experience in corporate software development since 2005. It aims to help developers and teams achieve consistency, quality, and "bliss" in their daily programming work.

## Core Purpose

The framework addresses common challenges in software development:

- **Consistency**: Establishing uniform practices across projects and teams
- **Quality**: Improving programming skills through proven guidelines
- **Interoperability**: Enhancing collaboration between different teams and projects
- **Simplification**: Streamlining development processes through clear standards

## Key Components

### Development Guidelines
- **Coding Standards**: Comprehensive guidelines for multiple technologies including C#, Elixir, PostgreSQL
- **Architecture Patterns**: Best practices for structuring applications
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming strategies across codebases

### Infrastructure Support
- **Docker Compose Templates**: Ready-to-use development environment configurations
- **PostgreSQL Guidelines**: Database setup and configuration best practices
- **Development Environment Standards**: Consistent tooling and setup procedures

### Learning Resources
- **Analysis Guidelines**: Methods for evaluating and improving code quality
- **Educational Materials**: Resources for skill development and knowledge sharing
- **Best Practices Documentation**: Accumulated wisdom from real-world projects

## Philosophy

The Bliss Framework is built on the principle that following consistent, well-tested guidelines leads to:

> "Improved programming skills and greatly increased interoperability among different projects and teams"

Rather than imposing rigid rules, the framework provides practical guidance based on proven experience in enterprise development environments.

## Current Status

The Bliss Framework is actively maintained as a Work in Progress, continuously evolving based on:

- Real-world usage and feedback
- Community contributions and discussions
- Emerging best practices in software development
- Technology advancements and changes

## Getting Started

The framework is designed to be adopted incrementally. Teams can start with specific areas that address their immediate needs and gradually expand their use of the guidelines.

Whether you're working with AI language models like Claude or Gemini, or developing traditional applications, the Bliss Framework provides the foundation for consistent, high-quality software development.
