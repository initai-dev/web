# Docker with Bliss Framework

Containerization and deployment strategies using Docker within Bliss Framework methodology.

## Overview

This section covers Docker containerization practices, Docker Compose orchestration, and deployment strategies that align with Bliss Framework principles for consistent, reproducible environments.

## Key Areas

### Container Development
- **Dockerfile Best Practices**: Efficient image building and layer optimization
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Development and production image strategies
- **Security**: Container security scanning and vulnerability management

### Docker Compose
- **Service Orchestration**: Multi-container application setup
- **Development Environments**: Local development with hot reload
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL, Redis, and other service containers

### Production Deployment
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes and Docker Swarm patterns
- **Image Management**: Registry usage and image versioning
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling and load balancing

## Environment Management

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Secrets Management**: Handling sensitive data in containers
- **Networking**: Container communication and port management

### Data Persistence
- **Volume Management**: Data persistence strategies
- **Backup Strategies**: Database and file system backup patterns
- **Migration**: Data migration between environments

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
- **Development Containers**: VS Code dev containers and remote development
- **Testing**: Container-based testing environments
- **Debugging**: Container debugging and log management

### CI/CD Integration
- **Build Pipelines**: Automated image building and testing
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment to staging and production
- **Monitoring**: Container health checks and observability

## Getting Started

Start with Dockerfile best practices and Docker Compose setup for local development, then explore production deployment strategies based on your infrastructure requirements.

These guidelines are derived from extensive experience with containerized applications in both development and production environments.
