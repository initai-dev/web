# Vite + Svelte with Bliss Framework

Modern frontend development using Vite and Svelte within Bliss Framework guidelines.

## Overview

This section provides guidance for building modern web applications using Vite as the build tool and Svelte as the frontend framework, following Bliss Framework principles for maintainable and scalable development.

## Key Areas

### Development Environment
- **Vite Configuration**: Build optimization and development server setup
- **Project Structure**: Component organization and file system layout
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload, debugging, and build processes

### Svelte Best Practices
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable component design and composition
- **State Management**: Stores, reactive statements, and data flow
- **Styling**: CSS organization, theming, and responsive design

### Modern Frontend
- **TypeScript Integration**: Type safety and development experience
- **Testing Strategies**: Unit testing components and integration testing
- **Performance**: Bundle optimization and runtime performance

## Build & Deployment

### Asset Management
- **Static Assets**: Image optimization and asset organization
- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports and lazy loading
- **Bundle Analysis**: Size optimization and dependency management

### Production Deployment
- **Build Process**: Production builds and environment configuration
- **CDN Integration**: Asset delivery and caching strategies
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and error reporting

## Integration Patterns

### API Communication
- **HTTP Clients**: REST API integration patterns
- **Real-time**: WebSocket and SSE implementation
- **Error Handling**: Network error management and user feedback

## Getting Started

Begin with the project structure and development environment setup, then explore component architecture and state management patterns based on your application needs.

These guidelines are based on production experience with modern frontend development and emphasize developer experience alongside maintainable code.
